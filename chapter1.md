# Introduction
In the small town of Maplewood, there was a hidden secret that only a few knew about. This secret was a game called "The Quest of Shadows. " It was not just any game; it was a life-sized adventure that blended mystery, excitement, and teamwork. Young people from all over the town gathered to try their luck in this thrilling hunt. 

Emma, a bright fifteen-year-old with a curious mind, was the first to hear about the game. She loved puzzles and mysteries, and the thought of an adventure sent shivers of excitement down her spine. One day, while hanging out with her friends at the local café, she shared her discovery. 

“Have you guys heard of ‘The Quest of Shadows’? ” Emma asked, her eyes sparkling. 

“What’s that? ” asked Jake, her best friend, who loved sports and often kept the group energized. 

“It’s a game that takes place in the old part of town, near the abandoned library,” Emma explained. “Players must solve clues and find hidden treasures. They say it’s full of surprises! ”

Jessica, another friend, was intrigued. “Count me in! I’m always up for an adventure,” she said. She was known for her artistic talents and had a flair for creativity. 

“Me too! ” chimed in Max, the quietest one of the group, who was usually lost in books. He liked challenges that made him think. 

The four of them decided to form a team. They named themselves “The Shadow Seekers. ” Excitedly, they planned to meet at the library on Saturday, the day the game officially started. 

Saturday arrived, and the air was filled with anticipation. The sun was shining brightly, making the town look even more beautiful. As they approached the old library, they noticed what looked like a scroll attached to the heavy wooden door. Emma carefully pulled it off and read it aloud.
